You’ll bring the data into the business, build the data infrastructure around it and deliver the data to the right person in the business to build their investment models.Tech is also completely flexible. Most of the work is done within Python, C# and Scala with a range of databases. Snowflake is widely used, as are Docker and Kubernetes for containerisation. ETL and ELT tech are also used every day, primarily Airflow, Spark, Hive and a lot more.You’ll need to come from a strong academic background with some commercial experience in a data heavy software or data engineering role. Financial experience of some kind would be a huge plus, but absolutely not a requirement. Experience with as much of the tech stack above is preferred and most likely, but you don’t need experience with all. Picking up new tech will be part of your job.This is a $60 billion plus fund, where being at the cutting edge of technology in general, let alone finance, is key for them. With this amount of ambition, it’s why their bonuses can be some of the biggest in the industry. First year total compensation could be as high as $400,000 and this has the potential to get better year on year, based on your performance.When in the office you have a fully catered canteen with a Michelin standard chef, barista coffee, a gym and more.Want to explore (or to continue exploring) high-tech in the Hedge Fund world?No up-to-date resume required initially, we can work on updating it together if need be before submitting.

We rely on data – lots of it – to improve autopilot, to optimize hardware designs, to proactively detect faults, and to optimize load on the electrical grid. We collect data from each of our cars, Superchargers, and energy storage devices to make these products better and our customers safer.We're the Fleet Analytics team, a central team that helps many teams leverage the data we collect. We help engineers through direct support by doing data analysis for them and through applications and tools so they can self-serve those analyses in the future. To do so, we leverage our internal data platform built on top of AWS, S3, Spark, Trino using open-source data science tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, Bokeh, Superset, and Airflow.
